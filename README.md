# Code-Mixed-language-detection
Codemixing is the mixing of two or more languages in a single sentence for eg. Hinglish. Brands use code-mixing to attract audience and make a better connect with them. They use it for their promotions.
We use social media handles of these brands like twitter etc. to get our data on which we do our analysis.
We try to classify tweets as Hindi, English or code-mixed using our Code Mixed Index (CMI) to determine the level of code-mixing in a tweet.
Now to find out the language tag of the entire tweet as either Hindi, English or code-mixed, We used a Code-mixed index.
